  <!-- Introduction -->

          <p id="intro">During the winter of 2017, a small group of us started
          looking into floating the Ruby Horsethief section of the Colorado
          River. Being that this was so far in advanced it was simply a small
          idea and the group wasn't sure if it would actaully happen. After a
          little bit of research and planning we were on our way for a 3 day
          weekend on the river.</p>

    <!-- Intro and Planning -->
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <p>One of the decisions that had to be made while planning was how
            we wanted to make the trip. Do we drive all the way to the float
            on Friday morning, or do we split the camp up into several days.
            From Denver the drive is roughly 4.5 hours, which made an easy decision.
            Let's break the trip up into an extra night and sleep a little closer
            to Loma. The first night led to a late night camp in Dillon, CO.
            We arrived in Dillon right around 8pm excited and hungry. While we were
            excited to get to camp and get the trip started we were also looking
            forward to being on a mini vacation. No better time for a beer at
            the Dam Brewery. After feeling completely clueless we figured we'd wrap
            the evening up and head to camp. The next morning brought beautiful views
            and even more excitement. With a fast clean up of camp we were on the
            road toward Loma, CO. </p>

        </br><p>With the help of a little permit snafoo we were able to enjoy

          the Mesa Community Library we hit the road, made a short pitstop at
          the Colorado/Utah border, then raced back to the Loma Boat Launch
          for some fun in the sun.</p>

        <p>Day one brought 13.4 miles of paddling, and believe me, after a
        long day of paddling, it was extremely nice to arrive at camp. Night One
        was stayed at Mee Corner. A very large campground big enough for multiple
        tents. Being that it was just the 2 tents we had plenty of room. Camp
        was awesome. The night brought trains, toads and scenic canyon views.</p>

    <!-- Day Two -->

        <p>The second day of the river brought a completely different vibe
        than the first day did. Since we did not have anywhere to be we thought
        we would sleep in and start the day slow. And with only a couple of
        miles of paddling that is exactly what we did. After only about an hour
        we were already to our second camp spot, Black Rocks 5. With deep waters
        and high rocks this is an adventurers dream. As we floated into our spot
        we realized we were in for a hot day, and we were right. With the sun
        beating down on us all day we needed to find a way to get into some shade.
        Luckily we were able to rig up a little shade to beat the heat While
        we took breaks from being in the water. With the cliffs so close to our
        spot we couldn't help but give it a shot. After a few minutes of building
        up the courage we were ready for the plunge.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the last day of the trip would bring more paddling.
        As we all live in Denver we were eager to get on the river and get moving.
        6 a.m. came too soon. With the sun rising slowly we were up and packing up
        getting ready for the long trip home. This was an eventful day on the
        boats. Once we passed the Utah border the wildlife made itself knows. With
        only a few miles to the car we were lucky enough to see a Bear and Bald
        Eagles. </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
        <p>This was the first of many river trips that will be had for us. It was
        not only a fun trip but the beginning of a new tradition. As backpackers
        we prepared as if we were going on an ultralight trip. Next time we will
        do it like the veterans of the river. Instead of packing light we
        will bring supplies in a little more luxurious way. More cold water and
        burgers would go a long way, and of course, COLD BEERS!</p>
